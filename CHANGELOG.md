## v0.0.73 (2025-11-21)

### Fix

- enhance prompt loading to support installed package structure

## v0.0.72 (2025-11-18)

### Feat

- Enhance agentic fallback and path handling: The `run_agentic_fix` function now returns a list of all files modified by the agent. Agentic fix loops (`fix_code_loop`, `fix_error_loop`, `fix_verification_errors_loop`) now display a summary of files changed by the agent and ensure error logs are properly initialized with parent directories created.
- Improve CLI help structure: The `pdd` CLI now uses a custom `Click` group to organize "Generate Suite" commands (`generate`, `test`, `example`) in its root help, enhancing readability and discoverability. The `generate` command's help text is also expanded for clarity.
- Refine output path derivation: The `construct_paths` and `generate_output_paths` functions are enhanced to support more granular control over output file locations, allowing different output keys (e.g., `output_code`, `output_test`) to derive their paths from specific input file directories in commands like `fix`, `crash`, and `verify`.

### Fix

- Improve file writing robustness: Commands like `fix` and `verify` now proactively create parent directories for output files (e.g., fixed code, tests, results) before writing, preventing errors in cases where the target directory structure does not yet exist.

### Docs

- **Prompting Guide Improvements:**
    - Added new references to "Effective Context Engineering" and "Anthropic Prompt Engineering Overview."
    - Expanded "Steps" guidance to "Steps & Chain of Thought," emphasizing deterministic planning and explicit step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks.
    - Introduced an "Advanced Tips" section covering: Shared Preamble for Consistency, Positive over Negative Constraints, Positioning Critical Instructions (Hierarchy of Attention), and Command-Specific Context Files.
    - Added a "Level of Abstraction (The \"Goldilocks\" Zone\")" section, guiding users to focus on architecture, contract, and intent, with examples of effective prompt abstraction.
    - Updated "Dependencies & Composability (Token-Efficient Examples)" to clarify examples as "compressed interfaces" and module interfaces, with a tip to use `pdd auto-deps`.
    - Refined PDD Workflow steps and added a "Workflow Cheatsheet: Features vs. Bugs" table, with a strong emphasis on writing new failing tests for bugs and updating prompts (not patching code) for fixes.

### Tests

- Update agentic fix tests: Test assertions in `tests/test_agentic_fix.py` are updated to account for the new `changed_files` return value.
- Enhance path construction tests: `tests/test_construct_paths.py` includes new tests for the improved `input_file_dirs` handling.
- Refactor file writing tests: `tests/test_fix_main.py` and `tests/test_fix_verification_main.py` are adjusted to use `pathlib.Path` objects consistently for file operations and verify the new directory creation logic.

Many thanks to Jiamin Cai for your contributions around your continued improvements to the agentic fallback and path handling and thank you to Kante Tran for your work on the CLI help improvements!

## v0.0.71 (2025-11-18)

### Feat

- `pdd update` repository mode now walks the Git root, creates/updates prompts inside the shared `prompts/` directory, honors `--output` directories during regeneration, and blocks file-only switches (`--input-code`, `--git`, etc.) so repo-wide refreshes can be scripted safely.
- Default output derivation for file-scoped commands (`fix`, `crash`, `verify`, `split`, `change`, `update`) now anchors to the input file’s directory (including relative `.pddrc` or env overrides), so regenerated prompts/tests land beside their sources instead of the current working directory.

### Docs

- README and PyPI description bumped to 0.0.71, moved the agentic fallback guide next to the `fix` command docs (noting `crash`/`verify` support), and clarified the `update` examples/options.

### Data

- Refreshed the LLM catalog and defaults: replaced Gemini 2.5 entries with Gemini 3 previews, switched the CLI default to `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, and added the latest GPT‑5.1 SKUs.

### Tests

- Added coverage for repo-wide prompt regeneration, prompt-directory summaries, construct-path defaults that follow input directories, CLI summary rendering with the new default model, and LLM invocation to lock in the catalog updates.

Many thanks to Jiamin Cai for your contributions around fixing the directory issues!


## v0.0.70 (2025-11-13)

### Feat

- Image includes in prompts: `<include>` now embeds images as base64 data URLs with sensible defaults. Supports `.png`, `.jpg/.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, and `.heic`; enforces max dimension ~1024px while preserving aspect ratio; converts GIFs to first‑frame PNG and HEIC to JPEG for compatibility.
- Multimodal generation: `code_generator` detects `data:image/...;base64,...` in prompts and calls the model with mixed `text` + `image_url` content, enabling image‑conditioned generations alongside normal text prompts.
- Prompt templates updated: clarify parameter validation/defaults (including `time=None` semantics) and document multimodal message construction and image include behavior.
- Minor: small enhancements around crash/agentic fallback flows.

### Examples

- Added `examples/image_prompt_example/` showing how to include an image in a prompt and generate a Python script that describes it.

### Docs

- Prompting guide notes that `<include>` handles images in addition to text; README and PyPI long description updated with the new version badge.

### Tests

- Expanded coverage for preprocess include flows (include‑many, recursive deferral for shell/web, curly‑brace handling) and added multimodal path tests for `code_generator`.

### Chore

- Version bump to 0.0.70 and dependency updates: add `Pillow` and `pillow-heif`; update `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, and internal version strings.

Thank you Jiamin Cai for your amazing contributions!

## v0.0.69 (2025-11-12)

### Feat

- crash command: add `--agentic-fallback/--no-agentic-fallback` (default on), wire into the iterative fixer, and always write `--output` and `--output-program` even when unchanged; improve path resolution, messaging, and summary output
- agentic fallback: normalize result shapes in fix loops, roll agentic cost/model into totals, and re-read final files on success to return the actual post-fix content

### Docs

- README and language examples updated to document crash flow with agentic fallback; refreshed agentic_fallback example READMEs for Python, Java (Maven/Gradle), JavaScript, and TypeScript

### Tests

- strengthen fix verification tests to ensure outputs are written on failure/no-op, propagate `agentic_fallback=True`, validate verbose/force handling, and refine attempt counting

Many thanks to Jiamin Cai for bringing the entire agentic fallback suite contributions to the project!

## v0.0.68 (2025-11-12)

### Feat

- add agentic fallback fixer with multi‑provider support (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI) and deterministic multi‑file patch application using explicit BEGIN/END file markers
- add language‑aware verification with sensible defaults (pytest, npm/jest, Maven/Gradle) and optional agent‑supplied TESTCMD execution on failure
- integrate agentic fallback path into CLI fix flow and harden the error loop with clearer logging, timeouts, and safer env handling

## v0.0.66 (2025-11-07)

### Architecture & Code Generation

- Architecture JSON emission and Mermaid rendering now produce deterministic formatting, `.pddrc` defaults stay in sync with those paths, and the regression suite (`tests/test_code_generator_main.py`, `tests/test_render_mermaid.py`) locks the behavior down so downstream tools always find the generated assets.
- The LLM toggle plus force flag flows through `code_generator_main.py`, prompt templates, and the Mermaid renderer, letting templates skip or re-run expensive post-processing per invocation; the CLI now pre-parses front matter, writes JSON outputs before post-process scripts run, and always regenerates architecture diagrams when `architecture.json` changes.

### Templates & Examples

- Prompt assets and their drivers now ship module-aware metadata (source/test paths, module names) so generated examples/tests import the right files; they also showcase the new `context/python_env_detector_example.py`, adopt the `--template` flag in docs, and drop the obsolete `mermaid_diagram.prompt`.
- `.pddrc` now declares explicit `src/` and `tests/` output paths for example contexts, and `generate_output_paths.py` bootstraps an `examples/` directory automatically so newly generated artifacts never depend on `context/example.prompt` or `context/test.prompt`.
- The hello sample workspace was rebuilt around `examples/hello/src/hello.py` with refreshed metadata, updated `pdd/generate_test.py`, and rewritten prompts/tests so the example mirrors the current CLI workflow.

### Docs & Quality

- Issue #88’s test-generation failures were fixed by tightening `construct_paths`, cleaning prompt instructions, passing resolved file paths into the LLM, and enforcing absolute output paths during code-generation—covered by new tests in `tests/test_construct_paths.py`, `tests/test_generate_test.py`, and `tests/test_generate_output_paths.py`.
- Onboarding and troubleshooting docs now cover `~/.pdd/llm_model.csv` quota issues and explain the LLM toggle workflow, with the README/model docs updated to match.

## v0.0.65 (2025-10-24)

### Architecture Visualization

- Shipped `pdd/render_mermaid.py`, a turnkey helper plus `examples/tictactoe` assets for turning architecture JSON specs into Mermaid diagrams and interactive HTML, backed by regression coverage in `tests/test_render_mermaid.py`.
- Wired the architecture JSON generator's post-process hook so `pdd/code_generator_main.py` can toggle Mermaid rendering after each run, letting templates emit diagrams automatically.

### Data & Models

- Documented the Snowflake-hosted `openai/claude-sonnet-4-5` endpoint in `data/llm_model.csv`, including credentials, context limits, and billing metadata.

## v0.0.64 (2025-10-12)

## v0.0.63 (2025-10-12)

### Prompt Templates

## v0.0.62 (2025-10-02)

### CLI & Templates

- `pdd templates show` now renders summary, variables, and examples with Rich tables for clearer output.

### Prompt Validation & Regression

- Regression harnesses wrap prompts with the required tags, validate architecture `dataSources`, and surface schema errors earlier in `tests/regression.sh`. Thanks James Levine and Sai Vathsavayi for your debugging efforts!
- Expanded coverage in `tests/test_preprocess.py` and `tests/test_code_generator_main.py` to exercise brace protection, optional template variables, and architecture generation workflows.

### Docs

- Added `docs/prompting_guide.md`, refreshed onboarding/tutorial guides, and introduced `AGENTS.md` as a quick-reference to repository conventions.
- Documented the `dataSources` contract in the README and architecture template, highlighting required fields and schema expectations.

### Data & Model Metadata

- Added Prisma, Verilog, and SystemVerilog entries to `data/language_format.csv` to expand supported formats. Thanks Dan Barrowman for the Contributions!
